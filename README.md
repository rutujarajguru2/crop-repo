# Azure Services Used

Core Azure Services:

Azure App Service: Deployed the backend for the crop recommendation system, managing functionalities and data processing.

Azure Storage Service: Utilized for storing historical agricultural data in Blob containers, ensuring persistence for model training and access.

Azure AI Service:

Azure Language Studio (Azure AI QnAMaker Service): Implemented a chatbot on the web app, facilitating user interactions and providing agricultural knowledge and recommendations.

# Problem Statement
Agriculture faces challenges in optimal crop selection based on various environmental factors. The objective is to leverage historical agricultural data to predict and recommend suitable crops for cultivation.

# Project Description
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides recommendations for suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about crop selection, optimizing yields, and maximizing profitability.

The system takes into account several factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to the specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

# Key Features
Data Storage: Utilizes Azure Storage Service to persist historical agricultural data.
Model Deployment: Hosts the recommendation model on Azure App Service for real-time predictions.
Chatbot Integration: Implements an Azure-based chatbot for user interactions, providing crop recommendations and agricultural insights.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
Flask: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages used for designing the web interface.
JavaScript: Scripting language used for client-side interactions and enhancing the user interface.


# Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time weather data to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
Incorporation of crop market prices and profitability analysis to assist farmers in making economically viable decisions.
Development of a mobile application for convenient access and usage on smartphones and tablets.
Integration of user feedback and data collection to continuously enhance the recommendation system's performance.
